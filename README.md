# Employee Attrition Analysis: Overtime & Attrition

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes **employee attrition** using an HR dataset, with a primary focus on understanding how **overtime work** relates to the likelihood of employees leaving an organization. Employee attrition is a critical business issue, as high turnover leads to increased costs, reduced productivity, and organizational disruption.

The analysis uses Python and statistical methods to explore patterns in attrition and to compare attrition rates between employees who work overtime and those who do not.

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajinkyachintawar/employee-attrition-and-retention-analytics-dataset?resource=download
